# Entrepreneurship

**Entrepreneurship** is a design system focused solely on building landing pages that convert users into customers.

It is **not** a framework.

It is **not** a library.

It is **not** just a collection of CSS files.

It is a set of principles and implementations built on research and data-driven decisions.

## Principles (Work in Progress)

- Form follows function
- Content decisions are greater than any other
- Accessible design is just good design
- Converting > aesthetics
- If your intention is for the visitor to read something, make that shit legible as fuck
- Every element needs to work at 320px wide
- Mobile first
- Don't fear the whitespace; whitespace is an active element on the page
- No lingo, no jargon, no acronyms
